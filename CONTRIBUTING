# Contributing to CryExample
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible, whether it's:

- Creating a new Code example
- Adding explainers to existing code examples
- Fixing Bugs
- Fixing OMANOMONOMS badly written code ðŸ˜…

## Ways to contribute

### Add example code 

- Want to contribute code demonstrating how to do something in C++? Well Here is how you do it:
  1. Encompass Your code in a EntityComponent which can be placed into the level,  
  2. Make sure the code .h and .cpp files are together in their own file named after the component. (Also place it somewhere logical)
  3. Try and keep the code as simple as possible and specific to the one thing you're trying to demonstrate. Remember the project is aimed at begginers.
  4. Where possible follow the Cryengine Code style. (Link)
  5. Submit your code as a pull request. 

### Add comments and explainers to existing code
  1. Feel free to add comments to existing code where the may be nuiance or nonobvious reasons for doing something. 
  2. For larger explanations that require mulitple steps feel free to create a text file and place it in the directory of the entityComponent.
  
### Update the list of resources in the README.md
  - Do you know of a kickass project/tool/tutorial which would really help beginners, feel free to add it to the ReadMe.md.
